* About

[[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog/actions/workflows/test.yml][https://github.com/jakub-stastny/blog/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg]]

My blog engine written in Elm and Elm UI. My raw blog posts are available [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/data.blog][here]].

** Literate programming

In case you're wondering where are all the Elm files, you have to tangle code blocks from [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] files in =src= into actual Elm files using Org mode in Emacs.

* Setup

See [[./.env/README.org][.env/README.org]] for literate DevOps instructions on setting the project.

Note that this setup is more of an extension of dotfiles (and requires specific initialisation code which I have in [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/dotfiles][my dotfiles]]), it doesn't deal with installing Elm and the dependencies, for which I use [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/docker-project-manager][docker-project-manager]].

* Code documentation

This code is thouroughly documented. Just dive into the Org mode files in =src=!
